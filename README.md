# TSEC Hacks 2023 Project: Barter Buddy

Welcome to the repository for our project at TSEC Hacks 2023! This project was created in response to the problem statement:

> In today's age of consumerism, people have accumulated a large number of products/artifacts that they may no longer need, or they might need a product that they are not willing to pay high prices for. There is a need for a portal where a barter-like system can be implemented as a web/app. The aim is to reduce unnecessary purchases of items that can now be obtained from people who donâ€™t need them. Consequently, it also helps people get rid of their old belongings.

Our team has developed a web platform to facilitate bartering between individuals. Users can create profiles, list items they want to barter, and browse items offered by other users. The platform matches users based on their bartering needs and offers a convenient way to exchange goods and services.
